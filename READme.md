- Production value ARIMA model
- tested for stationarity through ADF test
- Considered transforming the dataset
- Considered seasonal decomposition
- Analyzed ACF and PACF to deduce lag order for SARIMAX model found m=4, 12 to be not meaningful
- Found optimal lags and performed residual analysis( significant in F test Homogeneity stats models Breusch Pagan, significant in Durbin Warson serial autocorrelation, barley passes shapiro wilk normality can be seen as approximately ~N(0,1) from kde plot  )
